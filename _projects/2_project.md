This paper is my work from Nov. 2019 to Aug. 2020, supervised by [Prof. Yingxu Lai](http://dmslab.hkg03.bdysite.com/index.php/people/yingxu-lai/) and [LECT. Jing Liu](https://english.bjut.edu.cn/info/1152/1586.htm).

Attackers can improve the effect of network attacks through a cooperative attack involving multiple execution nodes, called the conspiracy attack. Such a cooperative attack is more destructive than that carried out by a single malicious node. This study proposes a malicious node identification method based on correlation theory to prevent fault data injection attacks. 

The paper is being reviewed, thus detailed information will be added later.
