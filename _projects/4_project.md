Industrial Internet technology has developed rapidly, and the security of industrial data has received much attention. At present, industrial enterprises lack a safe and professional data security system. -us, industries urgently need a complete and effective data protection scheme. -is study develops a three-layer framework with local/fog/cloud storage for protecting sensitive industrial data and defines a threat model. For real-time sensitive industrial data, we use the improved local differential privacy algorithm M-RAPPOR to perturb sensitive information. We encode the desensitized data using Reedâ€“Solomon (RS) encoding and then store them in local equipment to realize low cost, high efficiency, and intelligent data protection. For non-real-time sensitive industrial data, we adopt a cloud-fog collaborative storage scheme based on AES-RS encoding to invisibly provide multilayer protection. We adopt the optimal solution of distributed storage in local equipment and the cloud-fog collaborative storage scheme in fog nodes and cloud nodes to alleviate the storage pressure on local equipment and to improve security and recoverability. According to the defined threat model, we conduct a security analysis and prove that the proposed scheme can provide stronger data protection for sensitive data. Compared with traditional methods, this approach strengthens the protection of sensitive information and ensures real-time continuity of open data sharing. Finally, the feasibility of our scheme is validated through experimental evaluation.
