Hello, I’m **Tong Tang(****唐通****)**, a MSc student at UCL Computer Science department, studying in Information Security MSc. I received my bachelor degree from [Beijing University of Technology (BJUT)](https://www.bjut.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"}, majoring in information security at [College of Computer](http://xxxb.bjut.edu.cn/). My research interests mainly focus on Network security and Machine Learning. I used to thoroughly explore many aspects of Protocol Reverse Engineering in [DMS Lab](http://dmslab.hkg03.bdysite.com/), supervised by [Prof. Yipeng Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/yipengwang1/home) and [Prof. Yingxu Lai](http://dmslab.hkg03.bdysite.com/index.php/people/yingxu-lai/). Currently, I'm particularly interested in network protocol analysis.

My resume can be downloaded [here](CV.pdf).
